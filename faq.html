                <h3 class="faq-question">What is Capital Finance Club?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Capital Finance Club is a student-led organization at Knox Grammar School focused
                    on corporate finance and asset management. We run structured educational workshops and the Knox
                    Corporate Finance Challenge, a flagship competition adapted from NYU Stern MBA curriculum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How is CFC different from other finance clubs?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">CFC is not tutoring, exam prep, or stock-picking discussion. We focus on rigorous
                    valuation reasoning, capital structure analysis, and judgment under uncertainty. Our programs
                    emphasize standards, documented rubrics, and outputs that can survive professional scrutiny. We
                    treat students as analysts and thinkers, not content consumers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Do I need prior finance knowledge?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No. Our curriculum is designed for Years 9-12 students with no prior exposure to
                    finance. We prioritize intuition and conceptual understanding over technical mechanics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Who can join?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Currently, CFC is open to Knox Grammar School students in Years 9-12.
                    Participation is selective and applications are reviewed on a rolling basis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">When and where does CFC meet?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">CFC meets weekly during lunchtime at Knox Grammar School. Specific room details
                    are provided to accepted members.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the Knox Corporate Finance Challenge?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">A six-week applied competition where students analyze real ASX-listed companies
                    and construct defensible investment recommendations. Participants are evaluated on reasoning
                    quality, valuation logic, clarity of argument, and demonstrated judgment. This is adapted from the
                    capstone project in Professor Aswath Damodaran's NYU Stern MBA Corporate Finance course.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Is the competition mandatory for CFC members?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No. The competition is optional but encouraged. All members benefit from regular
                    educational workshops regardless of competition participation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I compete individually or in a team?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Both. You can compete individually or in teams of up to three students.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does a typical club session look like?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Sessions include structured workshops on corporate finance concepts, guest speaker
                    Q&A sessions, and dedicated competition workshop time for challenge participants. All sessions
                    prioritize clarity, assumptions, and structured reasoning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Are there guest speakers?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes. We bring in finance professionals from institutions like PIMCO, subject to
                    school approval. Guest sessions focus on career pathways and real-world applications of finance
                    concepts.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Standards and Evaluation</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What are CFC standards?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">CFC standards require that all assumptions be explicit, valuations include
                    sensitivity analysis, claims be supported by public sources, and reasoning withstand direct
                    questioning. We use documented rubrics and calibrated judging to ensure consistency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I use AI tools?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">AI tools are permitted but bounded. You may use them for data retrieval,
                    formatting assistance, or exploratory research. However, analysis, valuation logic, and final
                    recommendations must reflect independent judgment. All AI use must be disclosed, and conclusions
                    must be independently defensible when questioned.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How is the competition judged?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Judging focuses on reasoning clarity and internal consistency, valuation logic and
                    appropriate use of frameworks, quality of argument and evidence marshaling, and demonstrated
                    judgment in handling ambiguity. There are no predetermined correct answers. You are evaluated on the
                    quality of your reasoning, not alignment with a specific outcome.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What resources and support are available?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Members have access to valuation templates, capital structure frameworks, public
                    data navigation guidance, and past case archives. Competition participants receive targeted workshop
                    sessions and rubric guidance.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Will CFC expand to other schools?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Potentially. The current iteration is a pilot at Knox Grammar School. Interschool
                    expansion will only be considered after a successful pilot, documented standards, and school
                    approval. Quality control takes precedence over growth.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How do I stay updated on CFC activities?</h3>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I contribute to CFC beyond participation?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes. We welcome student contributions in the form of written analysis, competition
                    case development, workshop assistance, and platform building. Strong work may be published on our
                    platform with editorial review.</p>
